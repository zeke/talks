## Session Title

Community-building and automation for open-source sustainability

## Description

Open-sourcing is about more than just making code public. It's about creating welcoming environments where people feel empowered to participate, and using automation to minimize human bottlenecks. The GitHub Flow is a creative process whereby code is continuously created, tested, reviewed, and delivered to customers. In this talk, Zeke will cover how teams at GitHub apply the principles of the GitHub Flow to open-source projects to make the them more fun, welcoming, and scalable.
